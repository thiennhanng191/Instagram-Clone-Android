# Project 3 - *Instagram Clone*

**Instagram Clone** is a photo sharing app similar to Instagram but using Parse as its backend.

Time spent: **12** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can view the last 20 posts submitted to "Instagram".
- [x] The user should switch between different tabs - viewing all posts (feed view), compose (capture photos form camera) and profile tabs (posts made) using fragments and a Bottom Navigation View. (2 points) (compose is a seperate activity since I based the design based on the ios version of Instagram)
- [x] User can pull to refresh the last 20 posts submitted to "Instagram".

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] User sees app icon in home screen and styled bottom navigation view

- [x] User can load more posts once he or she reaches the bottom of the feed using infinite scrolling.
- [x] Show the username and creation time for each post.
- [x] User can tap a post to view post details, including timestamp and caption.
- [x] User Profiles
  - [x] Display the profile photo with each post
  - [x] Tapping on a post's username or profile photo goes to that user's profile page and shows a grid view of the user's posts 
- [x] User can like a post and see number of likes for each post in the post details screen.

The following **additional** features are implemented:
